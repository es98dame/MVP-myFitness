# MyFitness App
A MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, and Node.js) CRUD app that helps people who want to lose, maintain or gain weight, keep a daily exercise log, track and manage their daily intake.. This app was primarily built to showcase my ability to develop with React and server-side APIs.


To Start This App for Development:

1) Start mongodb:
brew services start mongodb

2) Start server from server folder:
npm run server-start

3) Start React from client folder:
npm run dev

The server will run locally on localhost:3000.
The client will run locally on localhost:8080.
